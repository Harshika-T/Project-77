            Visual studio is a great app to practice your coding skills and try out new types of projects that we are interested in. To set up visual studio all you have to do is first download the app, make a folder that says Vidual Studio or Visual Studio Projects and in that you cane name your projects, then you have to say open folder and pick the folder you want to work on, you create a new file which says index.html, java script, or css, and finally you start working on your project.

           The console screen has the output of the code, to see how it turns out. It is used to see the output of our code and see if it turned out the way we want the app to be and fix the mistakes we made. We can open the console screen by finding the button that is used for it and when we press that it takes us to a page with our code on the side and the output on the other side.
